## CB Alerts - Pulls alerts from Cb Response writes to CSV

The Cb_Alerts script will export CSV files for each feed. This is different dataset than CB Feeds dump and provides IP addresses, domains and the report name from the feed such as "ZeuS IP Blocklist". The default INI settings will retrieve the last two weeks of alerts, so be sure to adjust the INI setting StartTime if you want a different timeframe.


## Cb Resolve - Resolve alerts in the Cb Response console

The Cb_Resolve script can resolve alerts in the Cb Response console. Filter in the Cb Response console to the alerts you want resolved and then copy and paste the URL into the script.
